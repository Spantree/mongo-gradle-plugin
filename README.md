This may develop into a full project and all the project structure that is required... but I don't see the need for that right now.  Starting with a script I used for a client.  This will require mongo on the client.   I figured this is likely and if it is this script will be helpful to some.  I intend to add the mongo dependencies to the script and invoke as a java process vs. requiring mongo to be on the commandline path.

todo:
1. dependency on mongo java libraries
2. provide client determination of this lib ??
3. 

** no plans for:
mongostat
mongotop
or sharding activities... these are administrative.  The intended support is for everyday developer activities.
